Title: Store Distance Matrices on Disk
Version: 0.1.0
Authors@R: person("Komala Sheshachala", "Srikanth", email = "sri.teach@gmail.com", role = c("aut", "cre"))
Description: Provides utilities to compute, store and access distance matrices on disk as file-backed matrices provided by the 'bigstatsr' package. File-backed distance matrices are stored as a symmetric matrix to facilitate out-of-memory operations on file-backed matrix while the in-memory 'dist' object stores only the lower diagonal elements. The 'disto' package provides an unified interface to work with in-memory and disk-based distance matrices.
